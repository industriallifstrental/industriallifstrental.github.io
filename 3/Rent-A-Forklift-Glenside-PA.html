<p>Specifically engineered for the unique challenges of a narrow-aisle warehouse environment, the Crown RR 5700 features the industry's first traction control system, enhanced execution of load-handling functions, and the fastest lift and travel speeds among other available reach trucks. The aim of this course is to provide delegates with the knowledge and practical skills needed to safely operate an Industrial Masted Lift Truck. Whether a forklift will safely carry a load or will tip forward can be determined by comparing the moment (a tendency to produce motion) of both the load and the forklift. Our rental fleet stands ready to supply you with immediate equipment when a need arises.</p>
<p>Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years. This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent.</p>
