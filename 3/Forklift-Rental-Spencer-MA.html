<h2>What You Need To Know When Buying Electric Pallet Trucks Spencer </h2>
<p>Do not overload a lift truck. The most common type of forklift has a heavy counterweight over the rear tires to balance the load. The height of these industrial reach forklifts also raises a concern about having collisions into doorways or overhead objects. We supply rental forklifts for the Napa Valley wine industry every year. The load capacity of a pallet jack is arguably the most important factor to consider before buying.</p>
<p>If you wish to eventually own your own forklift, we recommend that you consider the rent-to-own package that we have to offer.
