<p>Our friendly staff will work with you closely to better understand your operations and requirements, and help you choose the right forklift. Forklifts were first invented during early part of the 20th century and now had become a vital part of the modern-day industrial world. Their high capacity of up to three tons and easy manoeuvrability in tight spaces make hand pallet trucks the perfect warehouse aid.</p>
<p>In addition to rentals, they also sell new and used equipment. You shouldn't ever buy forklifts that haven't had a Thorough Examinations test done, and you shouldn't purchase from a forklift sales dealer who doesn't know the ins and outs of lifting equipment. Most standard forklifts can reach heights between 10 and 15 ft, but special forklifts like the telehandler can lift as high as 55 ft depending on the telehandler size you select.</p>

Control pedals and control platforms stood on or engaged by the operator's feet should have non-skid surfaces.

<h3>Why Manual Pallet Jack Safety Is Important Mena AR 71953</h3>
<p>We carry the largest inventory of Used Forklifts, Aerial Forklifts, Rough Terrain Lifts, Telehandlers, Attachments and Industrial Vehicles in Texas. Most forklifts contain either a traditional internal combustion engine or an electric motor. Prominently display the official OSHA Job Safety and Health - It's the Law poster 15 that describes rights and responsibilities under the OSH Act.</p>
<p>These rough terrain forklifts come with a higher ground clearance that is crucial to work on cross-country terrain. A forklift that is overloaded while lifting a load at height can very easily tip over forwards, with potential of causing serious damage to property, equipment, and people. But work can go a lot quicker if you have the right equipment to help you out—and pallet jack is one of the most convenient and efficient types of equipment out there for the job.</p>
