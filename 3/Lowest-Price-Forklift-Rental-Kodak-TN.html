<p>Counterbalance forklifts are probably the most common forklift trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores in the Vancouver area. While it's true that safety officials (OSHA) are more likely to inspect large commercial jobsites than residential or multifamily ones, they will visit any site where incidents have occurred or where complaints have been made.
