With the riding operator facing in the direction of travel, with the load trailing, clockwise movement of the steering tongue shall steer the truck clockwise. They typically have pneumatic tyres that are larger than other types of forklifts and have maximum load capacities of between roughly 1,000 and 18,000 kilograms.</p>
<p>The maximum capacity of reach forklifts is generally around 5,000 pounds. The weight of the forklift's battery can also be used to provide stability to the truck, so any change in the type of battery for the forklift can lead to instability. The Hydraulic hand Pallet trucks can handle palletised load up to 2500 Kg in a single haul and a single operator can lift and move this weight effortlessly over short distances.</p>

Rough terrain poses additional threats and risks to the operators of forklifts. However, suspension lift kits let the truck owners lift their truck as high as they want.
