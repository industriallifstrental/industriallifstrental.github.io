Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of order pickers.</p>

<h2>Truck With A Lift Brewster</h2>
<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>Be sure the load is centered and the forks are completely under the load before lifting. Use these machines to tackle residential or commercial landscaping jobs. 2.

Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance.</p>
