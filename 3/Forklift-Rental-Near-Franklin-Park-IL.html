However, reach trucks are not really designed for outdoor use. The heavy-duty models that can lift big loads have an even larger fork shaft and double wheels at the front. Powered pallet jacks, 4 also known as electric pallet trucks, walkies, single or double pallet jacks, or power jack, are motorized to allow lifting and moving of heavier and stacked pallets.</p>
<p>The counterweight on these trucks juts out much further than the next size down, resulting in a longer truck. Use only approved industrial trucks in hazardous locations.
