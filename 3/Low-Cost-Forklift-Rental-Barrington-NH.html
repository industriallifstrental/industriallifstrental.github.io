Yale Materials Handling Corporation markets a full line of materials handling lift truck products and services, including electric, gas, LP-gas and diesel powered lift trucks; narrow aisle, very narrow aisle and motorized hand trucks.</p>

The wheels and tires are key components that set rough terrain forklifts apart from standard models.</p>
