<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>If you do decide to go ahead and lift your truck, take extra care when operating it to ensure safety, and check everything underneath regularly for wear and tear to prevent and accelerated damage that may occur. However, the term rough terrain” does not imply that the forklift can be safely operated on every conceivable type of terrain.
