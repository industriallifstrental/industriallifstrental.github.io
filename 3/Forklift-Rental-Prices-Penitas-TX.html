Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers.

In the 1940s, forklifts became even easier to use, thanks to batteries that drivers could recharge. Because of the nature of their work and the environments in which they operate, using rough terrain forklifts can also pose numerous hazards.</p>
