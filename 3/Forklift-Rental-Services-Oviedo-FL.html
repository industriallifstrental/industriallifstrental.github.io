<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>Add on a 6-inch lift kit and 35-inch tires on 20-inch wheels, and it's simply massive. Backed with a team of professional and experts of the industry, we are involved in offering Roll Pallet Truck. We also rent out electric forklift batteries and battery chargers to eliminate your forklift downtime. Forklift attachment manufacturers offer online calculators to estimate the safe lifting capacity when using a particular attachment.</p>

Counterbalance forklifts are a straightforward appliance that feature dual forks for heavy loads and bulky items.</p>

For more information on what documentation you should have, both on site and in the office, see Rough Terrain Forklift Documentation‚Äù above.
