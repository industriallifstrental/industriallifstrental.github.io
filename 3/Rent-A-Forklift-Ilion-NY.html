Knowing how to lift the load and knowing the stability of the ground conditions is critical for safe operations.

These forklifts are also known as straight mast forklifts. Using the procedure outlined for this test an empty truck with the forks elevated to the maximum height should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 14 percent or 18 percent slope depending on whether the truck has single, rear-wheel drive (or brake) or dual wheel drive (or brakes), respectively.</p>
<p>While most standard forklifts can reach between 10 and 15 feet, a telehandler can lift to heights of 55 feet. As already mentioned, choosing a forklift with the right handling capacity is therefore essential. Forklifts come in a variety of shapes and sizes to do various jobs. You'll often see these forklifts traveling down the highway on the back of semi-truck trailers.</p>
<p>This means the lift truck doesn't have to face the shelvesâ€”it can drive straight while still picking up loads to the side. Powered by a lithium-ion battery, this electric pallet truck offers up to 3 hours of use. Depending on the quality of your shocks, you'll likely enjoy more control of your vehicle and higher ground clearance as well. We will focus on how to maintain your forklift's stability and handling, as well as how to lift loads properly.</p>
<p>Used Equipment - We have a huge inventory of professionally refurbished used forklifts available at each location.

<p>Our selection of rental equipment comes from leading brands that are trusted around the globe to deliver products that meet the highest quality standards.

But the counterweight is larger and usually of a different design, to increase the lifting capacity.</p>

Pallet jacks offer sturdy steel construction and often feature cushion grip handles for comfort.
