The load capacity of the forklift will restrict the load capacity of the order picker cages. These kits cannot be installed in vehicles with a unibody construction, such as the Jeep Cherokee.</p>
<p>Hydraulic Pallet Truck is designed with polyurethane rollers that allow the machine to operate easily. The suspension lift kit, on the other hand, actually modifies the structure of the suspension so it sits higher off the ground, giving you significantly more ground clearance. If you've got one, you know washing a lifted truck can be tricky. Don't wait - our lifted trucks have a high interest and they won't last long.</p>
