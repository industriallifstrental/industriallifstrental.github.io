We offer to our clients a Hydraulic Hand Pallet Truck that has high load bearing capacity and is provided with nylon wheels for quiet and smooth rolling over rough surfaces.</p>
<p>Lift Capacity: 12000 lbs. The Raymond 5000 Series order pickers deliver exceptional versatility, intuitive handling and easy maintenance. Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation avoid tipovers and accidents.

An unimpeded view of loads and the surrounding area are a fundamental requirement for safe truck operation.</p>
<p>REACH TRUCK: A self-loading truck, generally high-lift, having load-engaging means mounted so it can be extended forwardly under control to permit a load to be picked up and deposited in the extended position and transported in the retracted position (Fig. We primarily offer wide range of Forklift, Crane and other Heavy equipments on rental basis across all industrial sectors.</p>

Designed by CASE, Load Control automatically provides on-the-go mast cushioning that lessens load shock when traveling over uneven terrain. A big lifted truck looks rugged and will surely turn some heads, but there are good practical applications to lifting truck aside from making it look good.</p>
<p>An important aspect of forklift operation is that it must have rear-wheel steering While this increases maneuverability in tight cornering situations, it differs from a driver's traditional experience with other wheeled vehicles. They can reach heights up to 390â€³ Orderpickers are typically powered by 24- or 36-volt industrial batteries.
