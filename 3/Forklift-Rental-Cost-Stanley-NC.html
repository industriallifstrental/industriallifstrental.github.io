We sell many of the leading brands of forklifts and other material handling equipment including Linde.

Due to its sideways operation, side load forklifts can easily drive up alongside racks and load and unload without having to turn. Better ground clearance than cushion tire forklift, softer ride, but larger chassis.

Rough terrain forklifts have increased traction on the tyres for navigation over poor terrain. Always start the engine while seated in the operator's position—never while standing alongside the forklift.</p>

<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead.
