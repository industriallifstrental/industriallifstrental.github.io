<p>TYPES OF FORKLIFTS: fork crane models for industrial use within warehouses, hydraulic three-wheeled electric forklifts, etc. A heavy attachment lowers the amount of weight that the forklift can support. One of the top reasons to consider lifted trucks for sale is because of their rugged good looks. They also invest heavily in the design of their machines to ensure optimal performance even on jobsites that include limited access terrain and high-reach areas. The forklift is designed with a load limit for the forks which is decreased with fork elevation and undercutting of the load (i.e., when a load does not butt against the fork "L").</p>

Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
