<h2>Lift Truck Rental Tazewell</h2>
<p>Forklifts are powered industrial trucks used to lift and move materials in short distances. Operators get excellent visibility with panoramic views of rack, loads and aisle. Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well. This is an efficient way of picking less-than-pallet-load shipments and is popular for use in large distribution centers.</p>
<p>Click a link below to get your truck lifted with Pro Comp. Counterbalanced forklifts are the most commonly used equipment in virtually all material handling capabilities. Sitting forklift controls mirror automobile controls with a steering wheel and hydraulic levers for the forklift mast.

Maintain proper ride quality as well as wheel alignment with a Rancho 4" lift kit that is backed by a limited lifetime warranty for all customers.</p>

Standard 2-ton counterbalance forklifts can cost over $20,000 in good condition, and many cost much more when brought brand new.
