<p>First forklifts appeared already in the early 20th century, and were used in World War II. Today, forklift trucks facilitate work of thousands of people, especially in manufacturing and warehousing sectors. One of the main safety risks for order pickers is falling from height when exiting the cabin onto pallets, partially enclosed platforms or racking.

Our industrial counterbalance forklift truck training course is accredited by RTITB and will provide learners with the basic knowledge and practical skills involved in safely operating an industrial counterbalance forklift truck.
