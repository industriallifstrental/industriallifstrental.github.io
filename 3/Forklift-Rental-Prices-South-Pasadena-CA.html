<p>For trucks with tilting forks, the forks should be horizontal of at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable. The boom can reach out directly in front of the forklift, and it can be extended to raise directly above it.

<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
