<p>This workshop is designed for participants who have little or no working knowledge of operating a counterbalance forklift. Do not steer pallet jacks onto uneven surfaces and avoid steep inclines.

Class I lift trucks are extremely versatile and can be used in many areas of a production operation from the loading dock to the storage facility.</p>
<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing. Prior to 2011 all States and Territories of Australia independently regulated occupational health and safety in that state, including forklift licensing.</p>
