<h2>Used Material Handling Equipment Covington</h2>
<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>The operator stands in the sideways compartment while the forklift loads on its side, making it easier to maneuver through tight spaces. Our full fleet of forklifts, cranes and hoists provide ample strength, lift height, versatility, and the performance features needed for most applications. We supply only high quality, safe, reliable equipment and forklifts and will facilitate everything from selecting the right forklift, helping with finance arrangements, to a seamless delivery.</p>
