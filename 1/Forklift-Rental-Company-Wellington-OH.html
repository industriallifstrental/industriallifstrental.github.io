<p>Rough terrain forklifts can have a vertical tower, which lifts loads straight up, or a telescoping boom, which lifts loads up and out from the base of the machine. Maini's floor transportation range enables effortless transfer of heavy loads in your shop floors and warehouses.

And depending on the model selected and your intended application and work environment, straight mast forklifts can be powered by diesel fuel or propane. You could also look into becoming a warehouse manager, forklift driving trainer or forklift truck engineer.</p>
