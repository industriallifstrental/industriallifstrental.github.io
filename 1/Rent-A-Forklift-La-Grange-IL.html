This course covers how to safely and efficiently operate a rough terrain forklift, how to educate and evaluate other operators on their rough terrain forklift performance, identifying when and how to service and maintain forklifts and how to keep other workers around the forklift area safe.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
