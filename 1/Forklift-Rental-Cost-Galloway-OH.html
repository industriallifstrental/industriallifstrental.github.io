<p>As long as the needs of your business fit the abilities and the strengths of the forklift, both the electric forklift and electric reach stacker can be extremely beneficial to your company. Suspension Lift Kit: If money's not an object and you want to go all out for a kit that lifts both your body and suspension for maximum off-road capabilities, a suspension lift kit is the way to go.</p>

<p>Lifted trucks have a negative reputation for being unsafe, but that's simply untrue. This determines how heavy of a load the forklift can handle, and at what different heights. The LHM200SC pallet truck in the BT Lifter L-series is equipped with a scale to provide high-accuracy weighing during the material handling process. Lifted truck maintenance services require assessment of your brakes, shocks, wheels, as well as tires.</p>
<p>Most Trucks have custom suspension lift kit, off-road accessories, custom exhaust systems, billet grilles and much, much more here at Kutztown Auto.

The unit is compatible with all types of forklifts so that you can easily move within your facilities.</p>
