<p>The greater suspension travel allows the vehicle to navigate rough, undulating surfaces with less of a chance of the body striking the ground or any object you're trying to drive over.

<p>If your warehouse is stocked full of pallets, a warehouse forklift is an efficient way to carefully load and remove balanced inventory from industrial shelving. Visit your local big-box superstore like Costco's, Sam's Club, Lowe's or Home Depot, and it's hard not to notice all those forklifts. However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>

In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>
