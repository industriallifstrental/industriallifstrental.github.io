To be fair, suspension lift kits are necessary in certain scenarios Demanding off-road trails, especially when racing, require larger tires and increased suspension travel.</p>

If the truck is originally equipped with front end attachments, the truck nameplate shall also be marked to identify the attachments and show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination and capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation of the load engaging means with load laterally centered.</p>
