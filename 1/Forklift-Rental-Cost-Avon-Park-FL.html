<p>Short-term requirements - If you only use the equipment to smooth out business operations during busy months or for a limited period, buying a forklift might be too costly. If you already have one of our electric forklift trucks, it can be easily retrofitted with lithium-ion power. They are also sometimes referred to as pallet trucks, pallet pumps, and pump trucks.</p>
<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height for the limit of travel speed, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph C about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
