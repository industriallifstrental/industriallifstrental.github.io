<p>Specifically engineered for the unique challenges of a narrow-aisle warehouse environment, the Crown RR 5700 features the industry's first traction control system, enhanced execution of load-handling functions, and the fastest lift and travel speeds among other available reach trucks. The aim of this course is to provide delegates with the knowledge and practical skills needed to safely operate an Industrial Masted Lift Truck. Whether a forklift will safely carry a load or will tip forward can be determined by comparing the moment (a tendency to produce motion) of both the load and the forklift. Our rental fleet stands ready to supply you with immediate equipment when a need arises.</p>
<p>This Course has been designed for potential and existing plant operators who have received no formal instruction and those requiring refresher training. Rental forklifts are maintained to Crown's high standards and undergo comprehensive pre-rental inspections to ensure consistent performance and reliable operations. Buying vertical order pickers comes in handy when the main job is order picking at increased requirements for productivity.</p>
