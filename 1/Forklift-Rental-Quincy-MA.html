The most commonly used capabilities range from 3,000-6,000 pound components, however forklifts can range anywhere from 2,000-65,000 lbs or more.</p>
<p>Often one or more of these three types of reach trucks are used in warehouses. The result is a smarter, more scalable fleet of reach trucks. For 4-wheel internal combustion forklifts, options and accessories include mini-lever controls with an armrest that can be adjusted in three ways, an LPG swing-down bracket which can lower the bracket 65 degrees from the horizontal position, and a steering wheel knob that can make driving the lift more efficient.</p>

Pallet jacks offer sturdy steel construction and often feature cushion grip handles for comfort.
