<p>We are offering Premium quality Heavy & Medium Load capacity hydraulic Hand Pallet truck. It is the highest capacity stockpicker in the line, handling heavy palletized loads at heights up to 366 inches. You may also wish to consult with a custom truck body modifications expert for advice as to which types of vehicles will best meet your individual needs as well. This is why the aftermarket hardware can range from a minor lift kit to a comprehensive decked out vehicle.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
