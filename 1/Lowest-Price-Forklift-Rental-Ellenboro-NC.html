The lift truck market value and volume are contributed by the revenue and the forklift truck units sold across North America, Asia Pacific, Middle-East Africa and Latin America.

The larger tires allowed by lifted trucks is one of the biggest advantages for going off-road with this type of vehicle.</p>
