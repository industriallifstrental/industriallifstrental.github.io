Forklift rental and lease companies may have used forklifts for sale. According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the counterbalance load distribution are involved in falling load accidents more frequently than other types of powered industrial trucks.</p>

<p>State plans are OSHA-approved job safety and health programs operated by individual states instead of federal OSHA. One of the most popular adjustments to trucks is the lift kit - moving the entire truck higher in the air by changing out suspension parts. About 92% of these are forklifts, 1% are material handling equipment parts. This purchasing guide will examine the specific features that qualify the machines to be considered 'rough terrain'.</p>
