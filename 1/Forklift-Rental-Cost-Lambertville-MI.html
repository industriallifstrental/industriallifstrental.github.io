<p>Bobcat: Bobcat is one of the world's most recognized name brands in heavy equipment and it's easy to see why: they provide a wide range of machinery with rough terrain capability. If the Hydraulic hand Pallet truck is not overloaded beyond the rated capacity and not pushed around on very rough surfaces then it gives good service for a very long extended period of more than 5 years.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
