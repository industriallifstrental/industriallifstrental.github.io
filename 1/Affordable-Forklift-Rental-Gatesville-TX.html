This additional clearance requires installing larger tires and in order to do that, you need to get everything up off the ground more.

You don't want a truck that was lifted by some random mechanic since there is no guarantee the mechanic knows what he or she is doing. Since they can easily move from indoor to exterior jobs, these machines are remarkably flexible.</p>
