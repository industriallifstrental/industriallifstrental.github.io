<p>This early machine was used around construction sites and could lift about 1,000 pounds (454 kg) to a height of 30 inches (76 cm). Multi-Directional Forklifts are able to drive in all directions, allow for improved storage space and also prove significant increases in handling times. Body lift kits are typically constructed from plastic or polyurethane with a height of around 1 to 3 inches.</p>

Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
