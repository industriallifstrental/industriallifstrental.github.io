<p>Warrior Quick Lift Pallet Trucks are manufactured from heavy gauge steel, with durable tandem nylon rollers and steering wheels for easy maneuverability when under load.

The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
