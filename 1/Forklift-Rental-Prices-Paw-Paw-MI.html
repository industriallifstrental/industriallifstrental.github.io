<p>Easily movable sidegates allow operators to open the case-picking window, helping them to be more productive. Battery and charger included with rentals. If alternate capacities are shown for elevations lower than maximum, alternate capacities not shown may be 2 assumed to fall on a straight line between the capacity and the alternate capacities shown for each load center.</p>
<p>Also, the higher you go with a twist, the less down travel you will have, causing quirky handling, such as skipping across the road imperfections, rather that soaking them up. On 4x4 vehicles, this also causes an issue because you could over-extend a CV axle joint on a truck that has excessive compression, but limited droop. They handle different sizes of loads and are engineered to perfection.</p>

The Class I, Class II, and Class IV have a moderated growth rate over the forecast period as end-users are largely adopting Class III and Class V Forklift Trucks for the various applications.</p>
