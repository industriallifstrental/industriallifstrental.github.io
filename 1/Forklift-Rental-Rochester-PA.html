Because of the nature of their work and the environments in which they operate, using rough terrain forklifts can also pose numerous hazards.</p>
<p>But palletisation really enhances the material handling efficiency and throughput. These powerful machines can handle very heavy loads and operate on all kinds of difficult terrain.

Therefore, a fork lift operator must be able to use the machine to fit large, heavy pallets into relatively small areas, such as large shelving fixtures.</p>
