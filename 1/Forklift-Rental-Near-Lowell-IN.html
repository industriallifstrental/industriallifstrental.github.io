<p>While most standard forklifts can reach between 10 and 15 feet, a telehandler can lift to heights of 55 feet.

You'll often see these forklifts traveling down the highway on the back of semi-truck trailers.</p>
<p>This can occur if the forklift has loads that are over its designed capacity. Keep in mind that the higher you are lifting a load the lower the capacity will become. Self-driving forklifts, blockchain technology, ergonomic designs, virtual reality and lithium-ion batteries are all components of today's material handling equipment. In other cases, you may find that there are fellow lifted truck enthusiasts in the area who can provide you with additional information.</p>
