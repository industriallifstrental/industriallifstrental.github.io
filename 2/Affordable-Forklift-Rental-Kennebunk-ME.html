<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>If you are interested in Industrial Counterbalance Forklifts training, please get in touch using your preferred method and we'll be available to discuss your options. Means shall be provided for an operator on the elevatable platform to shut off the power to the truck. In a sense, reach trucks are far more "customizable" for a specific lifting task than sit-down forklifts could ever hope to be.</p>
