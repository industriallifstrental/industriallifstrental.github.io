Servicing industries including roadwork, forestry, agriculture, stock picking and more, we're Northern California's go-to source for Cat, Clark, Mitsubishi and other allied brand forklifts. Order Pickers : Use: Order picker trucks place the operator on an elevating platform along with the forks. 2It will probably be necessary to cover the surface of the tilting platform with a friction-increasing material such as liquid paint, adhesive applied tape containing friction material, or safety tread with perforated buttons.</p>
<p>Lift Capacity: 12000 lbs. The Raymond 5000 Series order pickers deliver exceptional versatility, intuitive handling and easy maintenance. Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation avoid tipovers and accidents. Forklift training has many names, such as forklift licensing or forklift certification.</p>
