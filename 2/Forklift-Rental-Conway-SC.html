<p>Electric forklift not holding charge? Best of all, these GMC lifted truck modifications do not voice the warranty. Most rough terrain forklift accidents are caused by operator error. With our years of industry experience, we are able to successfully cater to the variegated demands of our clients by offering them Standard Pallet Truck.
