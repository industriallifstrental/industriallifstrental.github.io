<p>These Class 4 forklifts are one of the most commonly used forklifts in the U.S., typically used indoors for applications such as manufacturing, warehousing, bottling, and trucking.

A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>Yes, it's going to be harder to get in and out of your truck, but a twisted ankle or scraped knee is a small price to pay compared to a truck body rocketing off of its suspension due to some shoddy craftsmanship.
