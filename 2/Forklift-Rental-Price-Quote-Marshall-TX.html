Due to the widely varying types of fork lifts produced, fork lift operation may require certification and licensure.

<p>Unfortunately, many lift kits and the companies that sell and install them, fail to educate consumers about the differences in their vehicle's handling that can impact safety behind the wheel. Start searching our inventory of 700+ forklifts with just a few clicks. By implementing the scheme, we can reduce the number of vehicles on the road by 40%. Cat® lift trucks is one of the most trusted forklift brands in the world.</p>

You'll often see these forklifts traveling down the highway on the back of semi-truck trailers.</p>
