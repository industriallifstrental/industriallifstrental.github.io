Our type of forklift at the Western Illinois University physical plant is a sit down rider type with the forklift that has a counterbalance in the rear. No forklift operator can predict every possible event.</p>
<p>Both sit down and stand up style forklift trucks are included in this classification. U-Shaped Pallet Weighing scale are specially designed for handling pallets thus (No Pit, No ramps) required. Our forklift rental programme is backed by the strength and flexibility of our branch network. The difference is that only the mast moves and not the front tires like an articulated forklift.</p>

Infinitely variable lift and lower control provides smooth control for precise platform work. Unlike Standard Counterbalance and Reach Forklifts, These forklifts are steered via the front swivel articulation of the forklift and are therefore much different to manoeuvre than regular forklifts and additionally have no pantograph feature for retrieving stock in narrow aisles.</p>
