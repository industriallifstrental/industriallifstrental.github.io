Another subtype of warehouse forklift, the counterbalance forklift, looks like a standard warehouse forklift—except it has no extending arms for the forward forks and the back is weighted to counterbalance the load. Another major reason why accidents occur is due to improper loading and unloading of the forklift.</p>
<h2>New And Used Forklifts Weehawken </h2>
<p>Our Toyota lift trucks for sale are all great options, but we also carry several other quality brands. The AM30, on the other hand, can easily handle heavy loads thanks to its 3000 kg capacity.

I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
