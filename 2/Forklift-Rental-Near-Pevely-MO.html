<p>As the name implies, reach trucks reach‚Äù into racking with an extendable carriage and forks to grab pallets that range from 2,500 to 5,500 lbs. This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it. If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>

<p>In a bizarre incident captured on surveillance cameras, strong winds lifted a truck off the ground and flipped it around on its front wheel before slamming it back on the road. Truck drivers from the Richardson and Garland regions won't believe the lifted trucks and 4x4 conversion trucks on sale right now at Young Chevrolet in Dallas.
