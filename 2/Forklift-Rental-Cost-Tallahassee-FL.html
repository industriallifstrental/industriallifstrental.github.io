<p>Telehandlers provide substantial lift heights over standard forklifts.

Ahern specializes in high reach equipment, which permits the safe lifting of people or materials to work at height.</p>
<p>Whether it is while the order picker is moving up and down or during driving, the operator's entire body remains safely within the confines of the truck - aided, among other things, by compact steering and a generous cab area. 27"W x 48"L forks feature entry rollers and tapered design for easy pallet and skid entry, and are reinforced for heavy duty loads.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck in standing is tilted to the slope specified in Graph E. Our company, over the years, with its vast experience in this domain offers wide range of Heavy Duty Pallet Truck for various industrial uses.</p>

<p>The 30 Wastemaster counterbalance forklift with telescopic boom is a proven cost saver. Any attachment on a forklift will reduce its nominal load rating, which is computed with a stock fork carriage and forks. Battery electric forklifts, powered by lead-acid batteries or, increasingly, lithium-ion batteries, include: cushion tire forklifts, scissor lifts, order pickers, stackers, reach trucks and pallet jacks.</p>
<p>Pneumatic tire forklifts have outdoor utility, max lift capacity of 120,000 lbs, larger in size than cushion tire forklifts & powered by LP, gas, or diesel. We have specialist delivery vehicles on hand to supply new and used equipment to your doorstep at a time to suit you - and we can collect your existing handling equipment for service, no matter what brand or condition.</p>
<p>In addition to rentals, they also sell new and used equipment. You shouldn't ever buy forklifts that haven't had a Thorough Examinations test done, and you shouldn't purchase from a forklift sales dealer who doesn't know the ins and outs of lifting equipment. Most standard forklifts can reach heights between 10 and 15 ft, but special forklifts like the telehandler can lift as high as 55 ft depending on the telehandler size you select.</p>

Also known as a straight mast forklift, the rough terrain forklift is designed specifically for outdoor job sites, especially on uneven surfaces. Ensure loads are stacked evenly on the forks before moving the pallet jack.</p>
<p>We also operate three trucks for parts collection in Johannesburg and share the use of a warehouse facility in Jet Park for these conditions.
