Operators of the Flexi truck are required to hold a certificate of training which shows they have attended a training course and passed a test to a set national standard.</p>

Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
