<p>Shall be located with the center of gravity centered 10 inches above the compressed operator's seat for sit-down trucks and centered 40 inches above the operator's platform for stand-up trucks. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test #OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable.
