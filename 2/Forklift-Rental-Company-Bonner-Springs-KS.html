These types of forklifts are designed to run on a variety of fuel types, the most common being liquid propane and diesel.

It may be necessary to travel long distances with the load to the rear in reverse for most forklifts. Frequency of use and pallet transport distance should be taken into consideration when choosing between manual and electric pallet trucks.</p>
