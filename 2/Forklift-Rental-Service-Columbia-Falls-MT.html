Different forklifts are made for different loading capacity and height of pallet racks. While some lifts, like body lifts, are actually pretty straightforward, a mighty suspension lift can require a lot of extra considerations, parts, and work.</p>
<p>Wang says that Hangcha will continue to invest in rough-terrain R&D, particularly in developing equipment with more tonnage and configurations. Rough terrain poses additional threats and risks to the operators of forklifts. However, suspension lift kits let the truck owners lift their truck as high as they want. They have been renting out equipment for over 50 years.</p>

<p>Counterweight - a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame.

Other key features include an intuitive multi-function control handle, patented open view mast, low step height, ductile iron baselegs and an exclusive suspension system for superior load stability.</p>
<p>Pallet jacks can be used to move pallets of new merchandise to the proper section where the merchandise needs to be put on display.
