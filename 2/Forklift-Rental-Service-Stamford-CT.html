Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of lift trucks and other materials handling equipment.</p>
<p>Local Yale dealers provide service and support, just as they would standard lift trucks. Not every warehouse manager is ready to pay for rentals with cash. Do not elevate the load when the forklift truck is on an incline. One of the biggest perks of rough terrain forklifts is that they can lift big loads.
