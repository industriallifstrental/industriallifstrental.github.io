The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it. If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>

<p>You will commonly see these lift trucks used at construction sites to transport and lift building materials.

Failure to secure truck or trailer with blocks can cause the trailer to move resulting in the forklift falling between the trailer and the dock. First, take the time to train your whole crew to use rough terrain forklifts.

However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
